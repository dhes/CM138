A client <strong>SHOULD</strong> ensure that a human submitter has an opportunity to review the auto-populated answers to confirm correctness as well as to complete or expand on information provided by the auto-population process.  When creating an &quot;empty&quot; questionnaire, the general algorithm is to create a QuestionnaireResponse with one item for every item in the source Questionnaire, including items with &quot;enableWhen&quot;, &quot;display&quot; items, etc.  If a question has a default, the default answer should be populated.  And the QuestionnaireResponse should point back to the originating Questionnaire.  Repeating items will typically only include a single repetition.  Other extensions and/or elements may also be populated if the system is aware of appropriate values.  Complex form designs with conditional logic or tight constraints on cardinalities may be challenging to auto-populate.

In the case of repeating questions or groups, typically only one repetition will be provided unless answer values exist that would support populating multiple repetitions.  \n\nPopulation of the [QuestionnaireResponse](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaireresponse.html) with appropriate data is dependent on the questions and/or groups in the [Questionnaire](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaire.html) having metadata that allows the server to recognize the questions.  Guidance on mechanisms to perform population can be found [here](populate.html).  \nRegardless of the mechanism used to link the questions in a questionnaire to a \\\"known\\\" mappable concept, solutions using this operation should ensure that the details of the question and associated linkage element are sufficiently similar as to safely allow auto-population; i.e. the question text and context must be sufficiently the same, the value set for the question must fall within the value set for the mapped element, the data types must be the same or convertible, etc.\"\n",

A client **SHOULD** ensure that a human submitter has an opportunity to review the auto-populated answers to confirm correctness as well as to complete or expand on information provided by the auto-population process.  When creating an \"empty\" questionnaire, the general algorithm is to create a QuestionnaireResponse with one item for every item in the source Questionnaire, including items with \"enableWhen\", \"display\" items, etc.  If a question has a default, the default answer should be populated.  And the QuestionnaireResponse should point back to the originating Questionnaire.  Repeating items will typically only include a single repetition.  Other extensions and/or elements may also be populated if the system is aware of appropriate values.  Complex form designs with conditional logic or tight constraints on cardinalities may be challenging to auto-populate.  A server MAY choose to traverse the questionnaire as if it were a human respondent, answering only those questions that are enabled based on previously answered questions.
